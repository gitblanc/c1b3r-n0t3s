This note focuses on:

- `whois`
- `dig`, `nslookup`, `host`
- `traceroute`/`tracert`

Before we start using the `whois` tool, let's look at WHOIS. WHOIS is a request and response protocol that follows the [RFC 3912](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3912.txt) specification. A WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests. The domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing. `whois` will query the WHOIS server to provide all saved records. In the following example, we can see `whois` provides us with:

- Registrar WHOIS server
- Registrar URL
- Record creation date
- Record update date
- Registrant contact info and address (unless withheld for privacy)
- Admin contact info and address (unless withheld for privacy)
- Tech contact info and address (unless withheld for privacy)

As we can see above, it is possible to gain a lot of valuable information with only a domain name. After a `whois` lookup, we might get lucky and find names, email addresses, postal addresses, and phone numbers, in addition to other technical information. At the end of the `whois` query, we find the authoritative name servers for the domain in question.

DNS queries can be executed with many different tools found on our systems, especially Unix-like systems. One common tool found on Unix-like systems, Windows, and macOS is `nslookup`. In the following query, we can see how `nslookup` uses the default DNS server to get the A and AAAA records related to our domain.

Pentester Terminal

````shell
pentester@TryHackMe$ nslookup cafe.thmredteam.com
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	cafe.thmredteam.com
Address: 104.21.93.169
Name:	cafe.thmredteam.com
Address: 172.67.212.249
Name:	cafe.thmredteam.com
Address: 2606:4700:3034::ac43:d4f9
Name:	cafe.thmredteam.com
Address: 2606:4700:3034::6815:5da9
````

Another tool commonly found on Unix-like systems is `dig`, short for Domain Information Groper (dig). `dig` provides a lot of query options and even allows you to specify a different DNS server to use. For example, we can use Cloudflare's DNS server: `dig @1.1.1.1 tryhackme.com`.

Pentester Terminal

````shell 
pentester@TryHackMe$ dig cafe.thmredteam.com @1.1.1.1

; <<>> DiG 9.16.21-RH <<>> cafe.thmredteam.com @1.1.1.1

`host` is another useful alternative for querying DNS servers for DNS records. Consider the following example.

Pentester Terminal

````shell
pentester@TryHackMe$ host cafe.thmredteam.com
cafe.thmredteam.com has address 172.67.212.249
cafe.thmredteam.com has address 104.21.93.169
cafe.thmredteam.com has IPv6 address 2606:4700:3034::ac43:d4f9
cafe.thmredteam.com has IPv6 address 2606:4700:3034::6815:5da9
````

The final tool that ships with Unix-like systems is `traceroute`, or on MS Windows systems, `tracert`. As the name indicates, it traces the route taken by the packets from our system to the target host. The console output below shows that `traceroute` provided us with the routers (hops) connecting us to the target system. It's worth stressing that some routers don’t respond to the packets sent by `traceroute`, and as a result, we don’t see their IP addresses; a `*` is used to indicate such a case.

Pentester Terminal

````shell  
pentester@TryHackMe$ traceroute cafe.thmredteam.com
traceroute to cafe.thmredteam.com (172.67.212.249), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

In summary, we can always rely on:

- `whois` to query the WHOIS database
- `nslookup`, `dig`, or `host` to query DNS servers

WHOIS databases and DNS servers hold publicly available information, and querying either does not generate any suspicious traffic.

Moreover, we can rely on Traceroute (`traceroute` on Linux and macOS systems and `tracert` on MS Windows systems) to discover the hops between our system and the target host.
