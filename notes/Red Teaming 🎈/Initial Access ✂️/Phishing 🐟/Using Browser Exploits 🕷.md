Another method of gaining control over a victim's computer could be through browser exploits; this is when there is a vulnerability against a browser itself (Internet Explorer/Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.), which allows the attacker to run remote commands on the victim's computer.  
  
Browser exploits aren't usually a common path to follow in a red team engagement unless you have prior knowledge of old technology being used on-site. Many browsers are kept up to date, hard to exploit due to how browsers are developed, and the exploits are often worth a lot of money if reported back to the developers.  
  
That being said, it can happen, and as previously mentioned, it could be used to target old technologies on-site because possibly the browser software cannot be updated due to incompatibility with commercial software/hardware, which can happen quite often in big institutions such as education, government and especially health care.  
  
Usually, the victim would receive an email, convincing them to visit a particular website set up by the attacker. Once the victim is on the site, the exploit works against the browser, and now the attacker can perform any commands they wish on the victim's computer.

An example of this is [CVE-2021-40444](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-40444) from September 2021, which is a vulnerability found in Microsoft systems that allowed the execution of code just from visiting a website.
