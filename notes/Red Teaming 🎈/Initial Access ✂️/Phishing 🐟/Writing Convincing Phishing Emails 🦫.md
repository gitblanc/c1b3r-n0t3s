We have three things to work with regarding phishing emails: the sender's email address, the subject and the content.

## The Senders Address:

Ideally, the sender's address would be from a domain name that spoofs a significant brand, a known contact, or a coworker. See the Choosing A Phishing Domain task below for more information on this.

To find what brands or people a victim interacts with, you can employ OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tactics. For example:

- Observe their social media account for any brands or friends they talk to.
- Searching Google for the victim's name and rough location for any reviews the victim may have left about local businesses or brands.
- Looking at the victim's business website to find suppliers.
- Looking at LinkedIn to find coworkers of the victim.

## The Subject:

You should set the subject to something quite urgent, worrying, or piques the victim's curiosity, so they do not ignore it and act on it quickly.

Examples of this could be:

1. Your account has been compromised.
2. Your package has been dispatched/shipped.
3. Staff payroll information (do not forward!)
4. Your photos have been published.

## The Content:

If impersonating a brand or supplier, it would be pertinent to research their standard email templates and branding (style, logo's images, signoffs etc.) and make your content look the same as theirs, so the victim doesn't expect anything. If impersonating a contact or coworker, it could be beneficial to contact them; first, they may have some branding in their template, have a particular email signature or even something small such as how they refer to themselves, for example, someone might have the name Dorothy and their email is dorothy@company.thm. Still, in their signature, it might say "Best Regards, Dot". Learning these somewhat small things can sometimes have quite dramatic psychological effects on the victim and convince them more to open and act on the email.

If you've set up a spoof website to harvest data or distribute malware, the links to this should be disguised using the **[anchor text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_text)** and changing it either to some text which says "Click Here" or changing it to a correct looking link that reflects the business you are spoofing, for example:

`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">Click Here</a>`

`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">https://onlinebank.thm</a>`
