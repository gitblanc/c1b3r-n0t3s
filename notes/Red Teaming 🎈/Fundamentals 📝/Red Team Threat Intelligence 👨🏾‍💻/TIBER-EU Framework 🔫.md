**TIBER-EU** (**T**hreat **I**ntelligence-**b**ased **E**thical **R**ed Teaming) is a common framework developed by the European Central Bank that centers around the use of threat intelligence.

From the [ECB TIBER-EU white paper](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.tiber_eu_framework.en.pdf), "The Framework for Threat Intelligence-based Ethical Red Teaming (TIBER-EU) enables European and national authorities to work with financial infrastructures and institutions (hereafter referred to collectively as 'entities') to put in place a programme to test and improve their resilience against sophisticated cyber attacks."

The main difference between this framework and others is the _"Testing"_ phase that requires threat intelligence to feed the red team's testing.

This framework encompasses a best practice rather than anything actionable from a red team perspective.

There are several public white papers and documents if you are interested in reading about this framework further,
