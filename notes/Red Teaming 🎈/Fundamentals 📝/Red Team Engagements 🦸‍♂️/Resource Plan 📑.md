The resource plan is the second document of the engagement plan, detailing a brief overview of dates, knowledge required (optional), resource requirements. The plan extends the CONOPS and includes specific details, such as dates, knowledge required, etc.

Unlike the CONOPS, the resource plan should not be written as a summary; instead, written as bulleted lists of subsections. As with most red team documents, there is no standard set of resource plan templates or documents; below is an outline of example subsections of the resource plan.

- Header
    - Personnel writing
    - Dates

- Engagement Dates
    - Reconnaissance Dates
    - Initial Compromise Dates
    - Post-Exploitation and Persistence Dates
    - Misc. Dates

The key to writing and understanding a resource plan is to provide enough information to gather what is required but not become overbearing. The document should be straight to the point and define what is needed.
