In this room, our focus has been on command-line built-in tools readily available on any modern MS Windows system. We didn’t cover Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools; moreover, we didn’t cover any programs requiring additional downloading and installation steps.

This task mentions three options that are not built-in command-line tools:

- Sysinternals Suite
- Process Hacker
- GhostPack Seatbelt

## Sysinternals Suite

The [Sysinternals Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) is a group of command-line and GUI utilities and tools that provides information about various aspects related to the Windows system. To give you an idea, we listed a few examples in the table below.

|Utility Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Process Explorer|Shows the processes along with the open files and registry keys|
|Process Monitor|Monitor the file system, processes, and Registry|
|PsList|Provides information about processes|
|PsLoggedOn|Shows the logged-in users|

Check [Sysinternals Utilities Index](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/) for a complete list of the utilities. If you want to learn more and experiment with these different utilities, we suggest the [Sysinternals](https://tryhackme.com/room/btsysinternalssg) room.

## Process Hacker

Another efficient and reliable MS Windows GUI tool that lets you gather information about running processes is [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/). Process Hacker gives you detailed information regarding running processes and related active network connections; moreover, it gives you deep insight into system resource utilization from CPU and memory to disk and network.

## GhostPack Seatbelt

[Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt), part of the GhostPack collection, is a tool written in C#. It is not officially released in binary form; therefore, you are expected to compile it yourself using MS Visual Studio.
