This room focuses on post-exploitation enumeration. In other words, we assume that we have successfully gained some form of access to a system. Moreover, we may have carried out privilege escalation; in other words, we might have administrator or root privileges on the target system. Some of the techniques and tools discussed in this room would still provide helpful output even with an unprivileged account, i.e., not root or administrator.

If you are interested in privilege escalation, you can check the [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsprivesc20) room and the [Linux PrivEsc](https://tryhackme.com/room/linprivesc) room. Moreover, there are two handy scripts, [WinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) and [LinPEAS](https://grimbins.github.io/grimbins/linpeas/) for MS Windows and Linux privilege escalation respectively.

Our purpose is to collect more information that will aid us in gaining more access to the target network. For example, we might find the login credentials to grant access to another system. We focus on tools commonly available on standard systems to collect more information about the target. Being part of the system, such tools look innocuous and cause the least amount of "noise".

We assume you have access to a command-line interface on the target, such as `bash` on a Linux system or `cmd.exe` on an MS Windows system. Starting with one type of shell on a Linux system, it is usually easy to switch to another one. Similarly, starting from `cmd.exe`, you can switch to PowerShell if available. We just issued the command `powershell.exe` to start the PowerShell interactive command line in the terminal below.
