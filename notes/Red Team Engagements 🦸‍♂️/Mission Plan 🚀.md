The mission plan is a cell-specific document that details the exact actions to be completed by operators. The document uses information from previous plans and assigns actions to them.

How the document is written and detailed will depend on the team; as this is an internally used document, the structure and detail have less impact. As with all the documents outlined in this room, presentation can vary; this plan can be as simple as emailing all operators. Below is a list of the minimum detail that cells should include within the plan.

- Objectives
- Operators
- Exploits/Attacks
- Targets (users/machines/objectives)
- Execution plan variations

The two plans can be thought of similarly; the operations plan should be considered from a business and client perspective, and the mission plan should be thought of from an operator and red cell perspective.
