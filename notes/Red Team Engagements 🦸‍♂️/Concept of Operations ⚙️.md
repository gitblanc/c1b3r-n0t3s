The Concept of Operation (CONOPS) is a part of the engagement plan that details a high-level overview of the proceedings of an engagement; we can compare this to an executive summary of a penetration test report. The document will serve as a business/client reference and a reference for the red cell to build off of and extend to further campaign plans.

The CONOPS document should be written from a semi-technical summary perspective, assuming the target audience/reader has zero to minimal technical knowledge. Although the CONOPS should be written at a high level, you should not omit details such as common tooling, target group, etc. As with most red team documents. There is not a set standard of a CONOPS document; below is an outline of critical components that should be included in a CONOPS

- Client Name
- Service Provider
- Timeframe
- General Objectives/Phases
- Other Training Objectives (Exfiltration)
- High-Level Tools/Techniques planned to be used
- Threat group to emulate (if any)

The key to writing and understanding a CONOPS is to provide just enough information to get a general understanding of all on-goings. The CONOPS should be easy to read and show clear definitions and points that readers can easily digest.
